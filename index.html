                <h1>Hi there!</h1>

                <p>I'm excited to introduce <em><b>Field Days</b></em> — a new community event where girls can come together to play big, fun field games in a relaxed, no-pressure environment.</p>

                <p>Think obstacle courses, tag, capture the flag, relay races, and goofy games with no pressure, no stress, and no tryouts — just laughter, movement, and sunshine.</p>

              <p>My name is Ryan Farrell. I’m a father of three kids and have been a long time youth coach in baseball for over 10 years, hockey for almost 30 years and grew up working as an after school and summer camp counselor. I’ve coached all levels from beginners to high school.</p>

              <p>I’ve become increasingly concerned about the specialization, length of sport seasons and the pressure kids are facing in sports at earlier and earlier ages. I also often look back at my time as a counselor with fond memories of playing made up games in the gym or on the school grounds for hours or playing large neighborhood games of capture the flag till late into the night. They’re both big reasons I have decided to create a fun program called Field Days where girls can come together to play big, fun field games in a relaxed, no-pressure environment.  Each session will bring something new and wacky and keep them excited to come back the next time.</p>
            
              <p>Once school is out, I am looking to start weekly or bi-weekly in the evenings at a local park or school field, with sessions lasting about 60–90 minutes. Right now I am looking to see how many girls would be interested in joining the fun. I am thinking of running groups of 7-10 and 11-14 year olds but it would depend on numbers.</p>

              <p>If your daughter(s) would be interested in joining, please click the link below to fill out the interest form (once for each daughter). Also if you have neighbors, friends or family who you think might want to join, <b>please pass this along</b>. Thanks!</p>
